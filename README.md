# DataMax Laravel Assessment 

## Solution Using Laravel-Lumen PHP Framework

    - Requirements

***Run Composer Install to Initialize and install project Requirements***
```bash
    composer install
```

    - Setting Up Server
***Point Apache or Server of Choice to public folder***

```bash
    php -S public/index.php
```

    - Test Requests can be found in the root folder of the project: requests.http



    - Development Choice

***To store data locally, I chose to use a portable JsonDB since it's a small project***

#### Note: The JsonDB library I'm using was created by Me; so the choice there was deliberate as well

    - Filtering books

=> You can also include filter parameters in your request to the books endpoint by including parameters in the query string as requested in the assessment requirements.
